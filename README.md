# Pong Game

The Pong Game project recreates the well-known Pong arcade game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. It features two paddles and a bouncing ball, and players use keyboard controls to move their paddles and prevent the ball from passing them. The game keeps track of scores and provides a fast-paced gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the Pong Game.
2. Player 1 uses the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to move their paddle up and down.
3. Player 2 uses the "W" and "S" keys to control their paddle's movement.
4. The ball bounces off walls and paddles, and each time it passes a paddle, the opponent scores a point.

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay with two-player controls.
- Paddles and ball are implemented using the Turtle graphics library.
